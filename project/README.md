## Chosen Idea
How AI can solve some of the problems posed by Covid.

## Overview
The COVID-19 pandemic is considered as the most crucial global health calamity of the century and the greatest challenge that humankind faced since the 2nd World War.
In December 2019, a new infectious respiratory disease emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province, China and was named by the World Health Organization as COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019).
A new class of coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) has been found to be responsible for occurrence of this disease.
As far as the history of human civilization is concerned there are instances of severe outbreaks of diseases caused by a number of viruses.
According to the report of the World Health Organization (WHO as of April 18 2020), the current outbreak of COVID-19, has affected over 2164111 people and killed more than 146,198 people in more than 200 countries throughout the world.
Till now there is no report of any clinically approved antiviral drugs or vaccines that are effective against COVID-19. It has rapidly spread around the world, posing enormous health, economic, environmental and social challenges to the entire human population.
The coronavirus outbreak is severely disrupting the global economy. Almost all the nations are struggling to slow down the transmission of the disease by testing & treating patients, quarantining suspected persons through contact tracing, restricting large gatherings, maintaining complete or partial lock down etc.

## Goals
The COVID-19 pandemic has left its impact on every industry, especially on the global economy and financial sector.
Bank helplines are receiving a lot of calls with general queries regarding loans, mortgages, bank charges, etc. which keeps the helpline and helpline agents occupied.

## My Solution
Therefore, to reduce the workload and save time for customers and helpline agents I have created a COVID-19 Virtual Banking Assistant using technologies such as Watson Assistant for leveraging the chatbot and IBM Cloud for connecting Web Application UI to Watson Assistant.

## Technologies Used
● IBM Watson Assistant — for leveraging the chatbot itself.
● IBM Cloud Functions — for connecting Web Application UI to Watson Assistant.
● Node Red - for generation and design of website
● Dialogue Skills – to train the chatbot to connect with the user

## Resources Used
• IBM Cloud
• Watson Assistant
• Node Red

## Conclusion
As a result of the COVID-19 crisis, we are likely to see a rise in online banking activity and a decline in trips to brickand-mortar branches.
The current pandemic has forced customers who once resisted online banking to adopt digital banking apps as their new default.
The more these customers realize how convenient it is to bank digitally, the less likely they are to go back to physical branches.
And as the importance of digital banking distribution channels increases in the aftermath of the COVID-19 crisis, we are likely to see significant acceleration of key digital trends so as to give customers and agents an easy online experience we have fabricated a next-gen COVID-19 Banking Virtual Assistant, with a detailed repository of both bank-specific and health-specific information resources , which can help safeguard them, their families and their money—both during the COVID-19 crisis and beyond.
